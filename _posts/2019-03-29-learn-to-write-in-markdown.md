## Title (this is where you put the title)
So this is my first post. I want to write something about it but I don't know what to write yet. But I think it is a good idea to start practicing markdown format writing. I have used markdown a lot of times (for example, editting on stackoverflow) but I never actually payed attention to the syntax. Supposedly the syntax is very simple.

``` bash
so this is the code section
```





And if you want to link something, here is the format to put links to pictures.

![]()
wait, the link to pictures doesn't work? I think I will have to figure out what is the correct link to put there.

## markdown (another title)
Here is how you put some link to another [site](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1621414/danyfang?tab=profile). 

```python 
this is another code section
def function():
    print('jekyll is awesome')
```
## More titles


Well, this is really no more content here.
